# Red Badger Robot Challenge

## Usage

I've implemented the expected input/output as unit tests.  
```
npm i
npm start
```

These are a subset of the tests, run:

```
npm run test
```

To see all of the tests.

## Notes

I seem to get different results with the third robot - they encounter the bad scent, face the top of the map, and jump off it just next to where their fried died. I'd like to keep investigating this, but I ran out of time.
